      we still got time for sustainability and reasonable application of ideas of
      sustainable development? It has been just over twenty years since the Brundtland
      Commission Report but, taken as an axiological term; sustainable development
      resonates with older historical horizons. At the heart of a long running history
      we are beginning to articulate more or less sustaining relationships between
      man and nature. We have described the (human) needs in the environmental, economic
      and social dimension of sustainable development to show some amazing shift in
      perception of sustainable development from local to global level. We are convinced
      that historical lesson of sustainable development shows there is no more time
      for sustainability, but time for SOStainability. Our proposed S-O-S in SOStainability
      means Save Our Sustainability! SOStainability represents the need to end the

      a long-term development of the selected Slovak cultural landscape types (plains,
      basins, uplands, highlands, and mountains) in approx. 200 years, which shaped
      the main land use features as well as on the recent transformation trends. The
      land use development analyses showed that from a long term view perspective
      several distinct periods can be distinguished. Each of these periods was characteristic
      for certain land use changes depending both on the landscape character or the
      socioeconomic situation. The recent trends as land use intensification (intense
      agriculture, sub-urbanisation, industrial construction) or land use extensification
      (agricultural land overgrowing) are considered to be common for the entire Slovak
      territory. Special transformation trends reflect more local conditions, human
      needs and preferences (construction of water reservoirs, wind calamities or
      tourism resorts) and though they are spatially isolated and small they influence
      the majority of Slovak inhabitants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0018-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"41-55","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":18,"title":["Transformation

      aim of this paper is to describe the species biodiversity of important woody
      species in the riparian zone of wide floodplains in the Protected Landscape
      Area (PLA) Pood\u0159\u00ed (Central Europe, Czech Republic). The analysis of
      growth in terms of particular species was carried out to find out their growth
      potential. Another task was to evaluate the diversity and health condition of
      all trees and to determine the occurrence frequency of important woody species
      (IWS) in particular geobiocoene type groups of wide alluvial plains. The tree
      classification pyramid (veteran-representative-successor-expectant) was built
      up to provide the sufficient number of diverse IWS in the area. In total, 3,419
      IWS were mapped in the whole area of the PLA Pood\u0159\u00ed (81.5 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>).
      In wide alluvial plains, the <jats:italic>Ulmi-fraxineta carpini sup.<\/jats:italic>
      geobiocoene type group (GTG) shows the highest diversity. According to the surveys
      carried out in the area under investigation it is evident that there are a lot
      of IWS here deserving protection and the proposal of the appropriate management,
      which should be represented by the pyramid mentioned above. The pyramid would
      provide protection and care for the registered trees to reach a respectable
      age and maximum dimensions. It is necessary to preserve the species spectrum
      of the IWS to maintain the gene pool of initial populations and biodiversity
      in landscape. Some species exceed growth parameters of the same species at other
      floodplain sites in the Czech Republic and even in Europe.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0014-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"57-75","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Important

      the Precautionary Principle in Designing and Managing Natura 2000 Areas (Exemplified
      by the Conservation of the Butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea Nausithous<\/jats:italic>
      in a Rural Landscape North of Dresden (Saxony))<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The
      precautionary principle is more and more incorporated into national law and
      decision-making on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
      In the coherent European network of protected areas Natura 2000, the precautionary
      principle finds expression in the obligation to provide favourable conditions
      for the long-term survival of species and habitats, especially of the priority
      ones listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.
      After describing principles, structure, implementation and procedures of this
      rather new instrument for nature conservation using the example of one of the
      various Natura 2000 areas in Saxony (Germany), opportunities and problems for
      biodiversity conservation are outlined with particular regard for the situation
      in an agricultural landscape. Special attention is given to the following questions:
      requirements of and actual threats to the target species (the butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea
      nausithous<\/jats:italic>), legal means and economic incentives for suitable
      measures, the management plan, and the role of stakeholders. It turns out that
      Natura 2000 could be an effective tool to advance nature conservation, and with
      special regard to the precautionary principle. Every effort is necessary to
      gain more public acceptance of Natura 2000, as well as to improve scientific
      knowledge concerning species and habitats under protection.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0002-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:33Z","timestamp":1344590013000},"page":"14-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Adopting

      and Landscapes - A Critical Comparative Appraisal<\/jats:title><jats:p>Ecosystems
      and landscapes are the two major spatial units for ecological research and practice,
      but their definitions and meanings are vague and ambiguous. Examining critically
      the meaning and complexity of both terms from a holistic landscape ecological
      systems view, the confusing applications of the ecosystem concept could be avoided
      by conceiving ecosystems as functional interacting systems, characterized for
      the flow of energy, matter and information between organisms and their abiotic
      environment. As functional systems they are intangible with vaguely defined
      borders. On the other hand, landscapes should be recognized as tangible, spatially
      and temporally well defined ecological systems of closely interwoven natural
      and cultural entities of the Total Human Ecosystem. Ranging from the smallest
      discernable landscape cell or ecotope to the global ecosphere, they serve as
      the spatial and functional matrix and living space for all organisms, including
      humans, their populations and their ecosystems. Both are medium-numbered complex
      ecological systems. However, the organized complexity of ecosystems is based
      solely on the monodimensional complexity of material processes of flow of energy\/matter
      and biophysical information. But the organized complexity of landscapes is multidimensional
      and multifunctional, dealing not only with the functional dimensions of natural
      bio-ecological processes and the natural biophysical information, but also with

      Analysis of Factors Affecting Wind Damage in the \u0160umava National Park<\/jats:title><jats:p>This
      project forms part of the \"Remotely Accessed Decision Support System for Transnational
      Environmental Risk Management\" (STRiM) project undertaken within the framework
      of the European Union''s INTERREG IIIB CADSES programme. The test took place
      in a 70 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>test area within the western part of the \u0160umava
      National Park. It is commonly known that windthrow occurs frequently in the
      \u0160umava Mountains, and it tends to occur in particular areas. The intensity
      of windstorms and the amount of damage caused appear to be relatively constant.
      In the case of \u0160umava, such meteorological hazards frequently become biotic
      hazards as they are often followed by bark beetle infestations. We hypothesise
      that, in particular areas, the incidence of windthrow, the amount of harm done,
      and the cost of alleviating that damage are in close relationship with natural
      factors prevalent in the area and with previous human intervention (forestry)
      in the landscape. Analysis of such factors, and a comparison with actual data
      on windthrow, showed that a) the most damaged stands were generally found on
      gently sloping sites of 8-15 degrees; b) the leeward side of elevations were
      more heavily damaged; c) non-natural forest stands were subject to more damage;
      d) damage increased with increasing stand density; e) middle-aged stands of
      around 12 years were at greatest risk; and f) the most damaged portions of the
      test area were located at sites with normally drained and deep soils. Further,
      landscape relief and active surface character appeared to play an important
      role in modifying wind speed and direction, thereby increasing the wind''s devastating
      power.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0008-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:59Z","timestamp":1344590039000},"page":"52-66","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Geoinformation

      The partially assembled mitochondrial genome of <jats:italic>H. galeatus<\/jats:italic>
      is 16,578 bp in length and comprised of 11 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal

      known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements,
      the most ubiquitous belonged to Class II- Subclass 2-Maverick elements, Class
      I-LTR-Ty-3\/Bel-Pao elements, and satellites. 45S ribosomal DNA was also abundant

      disturbances and seasonal changes significantly impact diversity and community
      composition of ants, but their effects are often intertwined. We investigated
      these drivers on Lang Tengah Island, a location with a pronounced monsoon season
      and three resorts that close during this period. We surveyed four sites, two
      disturbed and two undisturbed, before and after the monsoon season, using pitfall
      traps to sample epigaeic ant communities. Undisturbed habitats had higher species
      diversity, but both habitats (undisturbed and disturbed sites) have a high proportion
      of ants with characteristics of being encroached by generalist and invasive\/tramp
      ant species. Post-monsoon sampling yielded an increase in species richness and
      diversity. Seasonal changes, such as monsoonal rains, can temporarily alter
      ant interactions and resource distribution, potentially maintaining diversity.
      Future studies should validate these findings for ant communities under similar
      pressures, using ant composition and functional roles for conservation and management

      cell carcinoma (RCC) originates from renal tubular epithelial cells and is mainly
      classified into three histological types, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma
      (ccRCC) which accounts for about 75% of all kidney cancers and is characterized
      by its strong invasiveness and poor prognosis. Hence, it is imperative to understand
      the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of ccRCC to identify
      effective biomarkers for the early diagnosis and the prognosis prediction.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The

      and prey exist in persistent conflict that often hinges on deception\u2014the
      transmission of misleading or manipulative signals\u2014as a means for survival.
      Deceptive traits are widespread across taxa and sensory systems, representing
      an evolutionarily successful and common strategy. Moreover, the highly conserved
      nature of the major sensory systems often extends these traits past single species
      predator\u2013prey interactions toward a broader set of perceivers. As such,
      deceptive traits can provide a unique window into the capabilities, constraints
      and commonalities across divergent and phylogenetically-related perceivers.
      Researchers have studied deceptive traits for centuries, but a unified framework
      for categorizing different types of post-detection deception in predator\u2013prey
      conflict still holds potential to inform future research. We suggest that deceptive
      traits can be distinguished by their effect on object formation processes. Perceptual
      objects are composed of physical attributes (what) and spatial (where) information.
      Deceptive traits that operate after object formation can therefore influence
      the perception and processing of either or both of these axes. We build upon
      previous work using a perceiver perspective approach to delineate deceptive
      traits by whether they closely match the sensory information of another object
      or create a discrepancy between perception and reality by exploiting the sensory
      shortcuts and perceptual biases of their perceiver. We then further divide this
      second category, sensory illusions, into traits that distort object characteristics
      along either the what or where axes, and those that create the perception of
      whole novel objects, integrating the what\/where axes. Using predator\u2013prey
      examples, we detail each step in this framework and propose future avenues for
      research. We suggest that this framework will help organize the many forms of
      deceptive traits and help generate predictions about selective forces that have
      driven animal form and behavior across evolutionary time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15389","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]],"date-time":"2023-06-23T09:52:00Z","timestamp":1687513920000},"page":"e15389","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

      June 10 to August 15, 2020, 8,246 specimens were dually evaluated by the Abbott
      Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) and the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (EI) assays.
      Sex-stratified phi correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the
      concordance between Abbott and EI assay\u2019s quantitative results. Multivariable
      mixed-effect logistic models were implemented to evaluate the association between
      assay positivity and sex on a low prevalence sample while controlling for age,
      race, ethnicity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive
      therapy, and autoimmune disease.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>EI
      positivity among males was 2.1-fold that of females; however, no significant
      differences in Abbott positivity were observed between sexes. At the manufacturer-recommended
      threshold, the phi correlation coefficient for the Abbott and EI qualitative
      results among females (\u03a6\u00a0=\u00a00.47) was 34% greater than males (\u03a6\u00a0=\u00a00.35).
      The unadjusted and fully adjusted models yielded a strong association between
      sex and positive EI result for the low prevalence subgroup (unadjusted OR: 2.24,
      CI: 1.63, 3.11, adjusted OR: 3.40, CI: 2.15, 5.39). A similar analysis of Abbott
      positivity in the low prevalence subgroup did not find an association with any
      of the covariates examined. Significant quantitative and qualitative discordance
      was observed between Abbott and EI throughout the seroprevalence study. Our
      results suggest the presence of sex-associated specificity limitations with
      the EI assay. As these findings may extend to other anti-S assays utilized for
      SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence investigations, further investigation is needed to
      evaluate the generalizability of these findings.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15247","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]],"date-time":"2023-07-17T07:35:52Z","timestamp":1689579352000},"page":"e15247","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Sex

      bean water extract (FBW) and vitamin K3 (VK3) have been demonstrated to improve
      the muscle textural quality of fish. To better apply these two feed additives
      in commercial aquaculture setting, four experimental diets (control, commercial
      feed group; 15% FBW, 15% faba bean water extract group; 2.5% VK3, 2.5% vitamin
      K3 group; combined group, 15% faba bean water extract + 2.5% vitamin K3 group)
      were formulated to explore their combined effects of FBW and VK3 on the growth,
      health status, and muscle textural quality of grass carp. The growth performance,
      textural quality, intestinal characteristics, and oxidative and immune responses
      were analyzed on days 40, 80 and 120. The results showed that supplementation
      with higher doses of FBW and VK3 have no influence on growth-related parameters
      and immune parameters of grass carp. Notably, compared with the control, fish
      in the combined group had the highest textural qualities (hardness, chewiness
      and adhesiveness), followed by those in 15% FBW and 2.5% VK3 groups (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>
      &lt; 0.05). Also, FBW and VK3, to some extent, may lower antioxidative ability
      of grass carp, as illustrated by lower levels of GSH and CAT in 15% FBW, 2.5%
      VK3, and combined groups on day 120 (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.05).
      In addition, enhanced lipase activity was observed in the 15% FBW group. Taken
      together, the combined supplementation of FBW and VK3 was demonstrated to be
      a more advanced option than their individual supplementation in a commercial
      setting owing to the resulting combined effects on both the textural quality

      male amateur rowers were part of the study. All participants were instructed
      to perform an incremental test (IT), a 6-min<jats:sub>RT<\/jats:sub> test, and
      a retest. The validity of the 6-min<jats:sub>RT<\/jats:sub> was determined by
      comparing maximum oxygen uptake (VO<jats:sub>2max<\/jats:sub>) and power output
      (PO) between the IT and 6-min<jats:sub>RT<\/jats:sub>. Reliability included
      the coefficient of variation (CV), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC),
      and mean standard error between the 6-min<jats:sub>RT<\/jats:sub> test and retest.

      equaled 91.96% of the maximal aerobic power (MAP) generated in the IT (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>

      thousand. Among the cases, the hospitalization rate was 2.7, and the admission
      to intensive care rate was 1.7. The fatality rate was 6.5% for those hospitalized
      and 12.2% for those admitted to the intensive care unit. The highest fatality
      rate was 65.5% in patients aged 65 and above. One out of five morbidities was
      developed in 8.4% of cases within one year. The fatality rate of those who developed
      morbidities (40%) was higher than those who did not (5.5%). Being male posed
      a 1,886-fold risk for mortality, and each increase in age posed a 1,086-fold

      which arose during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, is a global public
      health issue. This study aimed to provide fundamental knowledge in proposing
      control measures to mitigate discrimination. We focused on two psychological
      variables: belief in just deserts (BJD, <jats:italic>i.e.<\/jats:italic>, the
      belief that the infected individual deserves to be infected), a psychological
      factor that potentially promotes discrimination and prejudice, and human rights
      restrictions (HRR; <jats:italic>i.e.<\/jats:italic>, the degree of individuals\u2019
      agreement with government restrictions on citizens\u2019 behavior during emergencies).
      Differences in these items, as well as their annual trends from 2020 to 2022,
      were examined in Japan, the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Italy,
      and China. In addition, the associations between BJD and HRR by country and
      year and the direction of the associations between them in Japan and Italy were
      analyzed. Online surveys were conducted annually, with 392\u2013518 participants
      per country and year. The BJD was higher in Japan and lower in the UK. BJD increased
      significantly from 2020 to 2021 in all countries, except in China. Meanwhile,
      HRR was higher in China and lower in Japan. The HRR decreased from 2020 to 2021
      in Japan and decreased from 2020 to 2022 in the US, the UK, and Italy. There
      were significant positive associations between BJD and HRR in Japan and Italy.
      Cross-lagged panel models revealed positive bidirectional associations between
      BJD and HRR in Japan and Italy, respectively, indicating that the HRR declined
      among those with weak BJD and that the BJD increased among those with high HRR.
      In Japan and Italy, the dissemination of public messages targeting those with
      a high HRR in the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak could potentially
      mitigate the adverse impact of the BJD, eventually reducing discrimination,
      especially when the infection is not attributed to the fault of the infected
      individuals.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.16147","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,28]],"date-time":"2023-09-28T07:08:59Z","timestamp":1695884939000},"page":"e16147","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Differences

      cells were treated with sublethal heat treatment to simulate insufficient MWA,
      and the effects of heat treatment on the BC cell phenotypes were explored. CCK-8,
      colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell, and wound healing assays were performed
      to evaluate the influence of sublethal heat treatment on the proliferation,
      apoptosis, invasion, and migration of BC cells. Western blotting, real-time

      showed that heat treatment promoted the proliferation of surviving BC cells,

      up-regulated TGF-<jats:italic>\u03b2<\/jats:italic>2\/Smad2 signaling and promoted

      An increase or decrease of TGF-<jats:italic>\u03b2<\/jats:italic>2 expression
      resulted in the potentiation and suppression of autophagy, as well as the enhancement

      models of density and abundance are widely used in both ecological research
      (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., to study habitat use) and wildlife management
      (<jats:italic>e.g.<\/jats:italic>, for population monitoring and environmental
      impact assessment). Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data
      from multiple sources, collected<jats:italic>via<\/jats:italic>different observation
      processes. Distance sampling is an efficient and widely used survey and analysis
      technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled<jats:italic>via<\/jats:italic>detection
      functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and fit them in a single spatial
      model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: first accounting

      modelling distribution<jats:italic>via<\/jats:italic>a generalized additive
      model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple

      distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance)
      and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly
      accounted for in final estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented
      in the<jats:monospace>dsm<\/jats:monospace>R package. We briefly analyse two
      datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data

      coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 and rapidly spread
      around the world affecting millions of people. With the growth of infection
      rate, many countries adopted different policies to control the spread of the
      disease. The UK implemented strict rules instructing individuals to stay at
      home except in some special circumstances starting from 23 March 2020. Accordingly,
      this study focuses on sensitivity analysis of transmissibility of the infection
      as the effects of removing restrictions, for example by returning different
      occupational groups to their normal working environment and its effect on the
      reproduction number in the UK. For this reason, available social contact matrices
      are adopted for the population of UK to account for the average number of contacts.
      Different scenarios are then considered to analyse the variability of total
      contacts on the reproduction number in the UK as a whole and each of its four
      nations. Our data-driven retrospective analysis shows that if more than 38.5%
      of UK working-age population return to their normal working environment, the
      reproduction number in the UK is expected to be higher than 1. However, analysis
      of each nation, separately, shows that local reproduction number in each nation
      may be different and requires more adequate analysis. Accordingly, we believe
      that using statistical methods and historical data can provide good estimation
      of local transmissibility and reproduction number in any region. As a consequence
      of this analysis, efforts to reduce the restrictions should be implemented locally
      via different control policies. It is important that these policies consider
      the social contacts, population density, and the occupational groups that are
      specific to each region.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10992","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]],"date-time":"2021-02-25T09:31:16Z","timestamp":1614245476000},"page":"e10992","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Sensitivity

      body curvature introduces error in fish morphometric data. Compared to living
      fish, the causes of such body curvature in fossils may be due to additive taphonomic
      processes that have been widely studied. However, a protocol that helps to correct
      its effect upon morphometric data remains unexplored. Here, we test two different

      misleading geometric variation), our results show that traditional approaches
      applied in living fishes might not be appropriate to fossil ones, because of
      the additional anatomical alterations. Namely, the best result for 2D fossil
      fishes is achieved by correcting the arching of the specimens (mathematically
      \u201cunbending\u201d them). Ultimately, the effect of body curvature on morphometric
      data is largely taxon independent and morphological diversity mitigates its

      conflict (HWC) is a pressing issue worldwide but varies by species over time
      and place. One of the most prevalent forms of HWC in the mid-hills of Nepal
      is human-common-leopard conflict (HLC). Leopard attacks, especially in forested
      areas, can severely impact villagers and their livestock. Information on HLC
      in the Gorkha district was scarce, thus making it an ideal location to identify
      high-risk zones and landscape variables associated with such events. Registered
      cases were collected and reviewed from the Division Forest Office (DFO) during
      2019-2021. Claims from DFO records were confirmed with herders and villagers
      via eight focus group discussions. To enhance modeling success, researchers
      identified a total of 163 leopard attack locations on livestock, ensuring a
      minimum distance of at least 100 meters between locations. Using maximum entropy
      (MaxEnt) and considering 13 environmental variables, we mapped common leopard
      attack risk zones. True Skill Statistics (TSS) and area under receiver-operator
      curve (AUC) were used to evaluate and validate the Output. Furthermore, 10 replications,
      1,000 maximum iterations, and 1000 background points were employed during modeling.
      The average AUC value for the model, which was 0.726 \u00b1 0.021, revealed
      good accuracy. The model performed well, as indicated by a TSS value of 0.61
      \u00b1 0.03. Of the total research area (27.92 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>), about
      74% was designated as a low-risk area, 19% as a medium-risk area, and 7% as
      a high-risk area. Of the 13 environmental variables, distance to water (25.2%)
      was the most significant predictor of risk, followed by distance to road (16.2%)
      and elevation (10.7%). According to response curves, the risk of common leopard
      is highest in the areas between 1.5 to 2 km distances from the water sources,
      followed by the closest distance from a road and an elevation of 700 to 800
      m. Results suggest that managers and local governments should employ intervention
      strategies immediately to safeguard rural livelihoods in high-risk areas. Improvements
      include better design of livestock corrals, insurance, and total compensation
      of livestock losses. Settlements near roads and water sources should improve
      the design and construction of pens and cages to prevent livestock loss. More
      studies on the characteristics of victims are suggested to enhance understanding
      of common leopard attacks, in addition to landscape variables. Such information
      can be helpful in formulating the best management practices.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.17497","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,31]],"date-time":"2024-05-31T07:24:37Z","timestamp":1717140277000},"page":"e17497","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Identifying

      importance of the gut microbiota in maintaining bone homeostasis has been increasingly
      emphasized by recent research. This study aimed to identify whether and how
      the gut microbiome of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and osteopenia
      may differ from that of healthy individuals.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Fecal
      samples were collected from 27 individuals with osteoporosis (OP), 44 individuals
      with osteopenia (ON), and 23 normal controls (NC). The composition of the gut
      microbial community was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>No
      significant difference was found in the microbial composition between the three
      groups according to alpha and beta diversity. At the phylum level, <jats:italic>Proteobacteria<\/jats:italic>
      and <jats:italic>Fusobacteriota<\/jats:italic> were significantly higher and
      <jats:italic>Synergistota<\/jats:italic> was significantly lower in the ON group
      than in the NC group. At the genus level, <jats:italic>Roseburia, Clostridia_UCG.014,
      Agathobacter, Dialis<\/jats:italic>ter and <jats:italic>Lactobacillus<\/jats:italic>
      differed between the OP and NC groups as well as between the ON and NC groups
      (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). Linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe)
      analysis results showed that one phylum community and eighteen genus communities
      were enriched in the NC, ON and OP groups, respectively. Spearman correlation
      analysis showed that the abundance of the <jats:italic>Dialister<\/jats:italic>
      genus was positively correlated with BMD and T score at the lumbar spine (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>
      &lt; 0.05). Functional predictions revealed that pathways relevant to amino
      acid biosynthesis, vitamin biosynthesis, and nucleotide metabolism were enriched
      in the NC group. On the other hand, pathways relevant to metabolites degradation
      and carbohydrate metabolism were mainly enriched in the ON and OP groups respectively.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Our

      in the sagittal plane. The aim of this study was to compare the thoracic kyphosis
      and lumbar lordosis of male and female yoga practitioners with non-practicing
      participants and to determine the possible dependencies between sagittal spinal
      curvatures and somatic parameters, time spent on yoga exercise, and undertaking

      = 20.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3) as a control group. The angles of thoracic kyphosis

      kyphosis and lumbar lordosis and were more often characterized by normal or
      smaller thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis than students from the control
      group. In yoga practitioners, the angle of thoracic kyphosis was positively
